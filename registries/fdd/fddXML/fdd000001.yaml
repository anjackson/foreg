      audio bitstream with other data chunks. One common bitstream encoding is  (Linear

      one of the Broadcast WAVE variants,  or , both standards of the European Broadcast
      Union.

  notes:
    general: |-
      From the Wikipedia article  (consulted October 26, 2012): "RF64 is a BWF-compatible multichannel file format enabling file sizes to exceed 4 GB. It has been specified by the European Broadcasting Union.

      The file format is designed to meet the requirements for multichannel sound in broadcasting and audio archiving. It is based on the Microsoft RIFF/WAVE format and Wave Format Extensible for multichannel parameters. Additions are made to the basic specification to allow for more than 4 GB file sizes when needed (the new maximum filesize is now approximately 16 exabytes). . . .  In its basic form, the 32-bit chunk size field at offset 4 in the file is set to -1 (0xFFFFFFFF), and immediately following that a new 'DS64' chunk is inserted (before the FMT chunk). This new DS64 chunk will contain the 64-bit sizes of the DATA chunk(s), using a simple sequential table mechanism to point to additional DATA chunks. The first 4 bytes of the file are then changed from 'RIFF' to 'RF64'. . . .  An RF64 file with a bext chunk becomes an MBWF-file. The terms ‘RF64’ and ‘MBWF’ can then be considered synonymous.
    history:
      p:
      - Format created by Microsoft and introduced with Windows 3.1.  Adopted as basis
        for European Broadcasting Union (EBU) Broadcast Wave standard.
      - With Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced a WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE header which
        specifies multiple audio channel data (surround sound) along with speaker
        positions.  This enhancement provided for custom extensions to the format
        chunk.  Ambiguity relating to sample types and container sizes in the standard
        WAV format was also addressed.
